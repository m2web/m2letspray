# See http://help.github.com/ignore-files/ for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global

#will need to ignore this for your production implemenation

###Note that the configurations for Facebook authentication are set on Heroku by the doing the following###
#1. update the settings.json file with the content of the settings_live.json file that is set to be ignored below.
#2. issue the following from a command prompt: heroku config:add METEOR_SETTINGS="$(cat settings.json)".
#Or you could login to the app's dashboard at https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/m2letspray/, go to Settings and change it there
#Simply changing and then uploading the settings.json file will not update the config in Heroku.
